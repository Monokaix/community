Unrestricted Licenses: Open source software with an unrestricted license can be directly introduced directly.

Reciprocal Licenses: Open source software with an reciprocal license be used but can not be modified.

### Expectations 

They should take corresponding responsibilities to ensure that the licenses introduced by the community comply with open source compliance specifications, and make timely corrections when there are compliance risks. For example, for GPL licenses, relevant open source obligations should be fully fulfilled in open source software compliance projects,  SBOM and source code should be provided in projects. Characters who do not comply with the above behavior can be removed and re-elected.
